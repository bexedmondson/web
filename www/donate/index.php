			<p>We work hard to create beautifully-formatted ebooks that are free of cost and free of U.S. copyright restrictions. It takes a team of highly-skilled specialists working together for weeks and even months to ensure that an ebook meets our exacting aesthetic and technical standards, before it’s offered to readers for free.</p>
			<p>The cost of producing even the most basic ebook is estimated to approach almost a thousand dollars; and that doesn’t include infrastructure costs like developing and maintaining our <a href="/tools">free and open source ebook production toolset</a>, editing our <a href="/manual">free Manual of Style</a>, project management, hosting, or bandwidth. <em>This means your financial contribution is critically important for us to continue bringing beautifully-presented literature to readers in the digital age.</em></p>
			<p><a href="https://www.fracturedatlas.org/">Fractured Atlas</a>, a 501(c)(3) public charity, is our fiscal sponsor. Your donation will be processed through their website, and their name will appear on your financial statements and receipts. Donations are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>
